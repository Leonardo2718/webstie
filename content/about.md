I am just an ordinary human, living life and trying to understand the world around me.

I love learning things. I'm curious about a wide range of topics covering programming,
math, science, music, philosophy, law, cooking, and studying different cultures.
I fluently speak English, French, Spanish, and Italian. In my spare time, I work on
personal projects.

I have a Software Engineering degree and work for IBM as a JIT compiler developer
on the Eclipse [OMR](https://github.com/eclipse/omr) and
[OpenJ9](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9) projects.
