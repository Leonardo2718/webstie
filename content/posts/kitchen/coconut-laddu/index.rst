Coconut laddus are a traditional Indian sweet, often made for festive occasions.
They're easy to make and taste delicious. As the name suggests, one of the main
ingredients used is coconut, so these are often a favourite for anyone who loves coconut.

You can easily find many coconut laddu recipes online, each with their own twist to
this classic treat. My recipe isn't particularly fancy (just two ingredients!), but it's
easy, quick, delicious, and can serve as a base for many variations of the recipe.

Traditionally, coconut laddus are made with milk, sugar, and coconut. However, using
sweetened condensed milk significantly reduces prep time and the laddus are just as delicious.

Here's the recipe:

.. container:: ingredients

  =============================== =========================
  Sweetened condensed milk        1 300mL can
  Desiccated coconut              2 cups + 3 to 4 tbsp. to cover the laddus with
  =============================== =========================

Instructions
------------

#. Put the sweetened condensed milk in a medium-size, non-stick pan over medium-low heat,
   stirring frequently. You want the condensed milk to become liquidy. Be careful not to
   burn the milk! If you see it bubbling or if it starts to brown, lower the heat
   immediately or remove the pan from the heat.

#. Once the condensed milk is liquid, set the heat to low and start stirring in the
   desiccated coconut. Keep stirring for 2 to 4 minutes or until the mixture becomes sticky
   and thick like cookie dough.

#. Remove the pan from the heat and set it aside for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the mixture
   is cool enough to handle with bare hands.

#. When the mixture is cool to the touch, make laddus by taking 1 to 2 tbsp. of the mixture,
   pressing it into a ball, and rolling it between your hands. Then, roll the laddu in the
   remaining coconut so it gets completely covered in it and set it aside on a clean dish.

   **Pro tip**: butter you hands a little to make the sticky mixture easier to handle.

#. Put the laddus in the refrigerator for 30 to 45 minutes to let them cool off.
   Once they're cold, you can put them in an airtight container for storage (if you put
   them in a container when they're still warm, they will stick to each other).

Enjoy! These laddus can last about a week in the refrigerator ;)

Variations

There are countless variations of this recipe you can make. Here are a few ideas:

- Get a slightly spicier, more exotic taste by adding cardamom powder (about 1/4 tsp.).
- Make this recipe vegan friendly by using condensed coconut milk instead of regular
  condensed milk. Just vary the amount of desiccated coconut as needed to get the
  right texture.
- Add some honey to get a little extra flavour and sweetness.
